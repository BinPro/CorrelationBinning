Data generation:
Generation of x contigs, random start position, length x from genomes, chosen so that there will be at least x species within each genera and at least x genera within each family.

The number of contigs are chosen in a non obvious way.

Fit multinomial parameters to the genomes used.

Score each contig against all genomes. 

Result processing:
Classify each contig to belong to the genome where it scored its max and plot statisitcs in graph with ROC_curve.py
