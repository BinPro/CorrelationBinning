Data generation:
Generation of x contigs, random start position, length 1000 from genomes, chosen so that there will be at least 2 species within each genera and at least 2 genera within each family.

Data is generated only once, saved to FASTA-file in data directory.

The number of contigs are chosen in a non obvious way.

Fit multinomial parameters to the genomes used. No probability is estimated = 0, all kmer_count = kmer_count + 1

Score each contig against all genomes. 
When scoring agains the genome that the contig originated from, remove the parameters corresponding to the contig, to avoid overfitting.

Result processing:
Classify each contig to belong to the genome where it scored its max and plot statisitcs in graph with ROC_curve.py
